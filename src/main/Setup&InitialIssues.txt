Wired according to Excel, based on datasheet p6 "MCP251863 INTERFACING WITH A 3.3V MICROCONTROLLER". 

*Except* 
STBY to GND
nINT1, nINT2, CLKO --> NC

TXD -> TXCAN 
RXD -> RXCAN

10kOhm pullup res on nCS
CANH and CANL connected via 120ohm res.

USED "acan2517FD.pdf" p21 "8.4 Connecting to an ESP32" for info. States default VSPI pins, but instead used custom pins according to LoopBackDemoESP32 in ACAN2517FD Example sketches, and specified the pins in SPI.begin().

After flashing, setup and configuration confirmation/possible error codes is not visible - have to press EN on ESP32. 

First connected without crystal, and received error 0x1 (Hex) = 0b1 (bin) => kReadBackErrorWith1MHzSPIClock.

Then connected 20MHz crystal with appropriate load caps, and got new error code 0x20000 = 0b10000000000000000 = kX10PLLNotReadyWithin1MS.

Looked this up within repo and found in line 347 in "ACAN2517FD.cpp". Above this, shows that this error code is generated by issues in the OSC register. Looked up OSC register in datasheet, saw that correct value needs to be set, in order to divide clock signal appropriately (p76 & p19). Looked in sketch and saw that settings/division were configured for 4MHz crystal, so I swapped for that, with appropriate load caps.

Then received no error codes, setup gave data about arbitration rate etc, data started being transmitted. SUCCESS!!
